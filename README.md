**User Management Dashboard**


This is a User Management Dashboard built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows you to add, edit, and delete users in a simple and intuitive interface.

**Features**

Add Users: Add new users with a name and email.

Edit Users: Update existing user details.

Delete Users: Remove users from the dashboard.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

**Technologies Used**

Frontend: React, Axios, CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

**Project Setup**

Prerequisites

Node.js: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org

MongoDB: Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas

Git: Install Git from https://git-scm.com

Steps to Run the Project

**Clone the Repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-dashboard.git
cd user-management-dashboard

**Set Up the Backend:**

**Navigate to the server folder:**

cd server

**Install dependencies:**

npm install

**Create a .env file in the server folder and add the following:**

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/userdb
PORT=5000

**Start the backend server**:

node server.js

Set Up the Frontend:

**Navigate to the client folder:**

cd ../client

Install dependencies:

npm install

**Start the React app:**

npm start

**Access the Application:**

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000



**Challenges Faced**

Dependency Conflicts:

Some dependencies (e.g., @testing-library/react) were not compatible with React 19.

Resolved by using React 18:

npm install react@18 react-dom@18

OpenSSL Errors:

Encountered error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported due to Node.js v17+.

Fixed by setting:

export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

CORS Issues:

Initially faced CORS errors when connecting frontend to backend.

Resolved by enabling CORS in the backend using the cors middleware:

const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors());

**Potential Improvements**

Authentication: Add user authentication (e.g., login/signup) using JWT or OAuth.

Pagination: Implement pagination for the user list to handle large datasets.

Search and Filter: Add search and filter functionality to the user dashboard.

Testing: Write unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

Deployment: Deploy the application to a cloud platform (Vercel for frontend, Render for backend).
